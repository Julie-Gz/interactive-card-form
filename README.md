# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

## Overview
This is a solution to the [Interactive card details form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). 

### The challenge
- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time:
  I was able to make the credit card input in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format

  This is a challenge I still haven't completed. I searched many ways to do this but I couldn't find one that worked. There is much for me to learn about accessibility and form validity. Once I have learned and understood how to accomplish this I will update this challenge.

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
  To complete this challenge I created three css files; the first for general styles, the second for large screens, and the last for small screens. Media queries were further used inside the files dedicated to large and small screens to accomodate the various screen sizes withtin these categories. 

- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page:
  This is another challenge I have yet to complete. The border-image property does not work with Input fields. I tried using pseudoelements and encompassing the input fields in divs, but that did not work. I will figure it out eventually and update this challenge.
